# Overview

My goal here is to familiarize myself with a lot of basic aspects of C#, including classes and reading/writing using an external file.

This program provides a simple menu with options for interfacing with and editing the contents of a csv file that contains entries for employees of a theoretical company.

My purpose for writing this software is to demonstrate what I have learned over the past two weeks, including the creation of a persistent menu, as well as working with class constructors and external files.

Here's a link showing how this code works:

# Development Environment

This code was written in C#, using the latest version of Microsoft's .NET SDK. The IDE used was Visual Studio Code.

# Useful Websites

Here is where I was able to find some useful syntax, as well as simple troubleshooting:

- [W3 Schools (They have a ton of useful tutorials on C# syntax)](https://www.w3schools.com/cs/index.php)
- [Official Microsoft C# Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/)

# Future Work

Some things I would like to add in the future:

- More employee info using different datatypes (birthdate, etc.)
- Functionality for editing different aspects of an employee, like changing their title when they get promoted
- Integrate the program with a SQL database
